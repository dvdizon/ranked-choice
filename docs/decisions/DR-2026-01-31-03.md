# DR-2026-01-31-03: System Admin Page for Integrations

**Decision ID:** DR-2026-01-31-03
**Status:** Accepted
**Date:** 2026-01-31
**Deciders:** User (David)

#### Context
System-level integration management was embedded as a hidden toggle on the vote creation page, which made it easy to miss and added clutter to the primary flow.

#### Options Considered
- **Option A: Keep system options as a hidden toggle on the create vote page**
  - No new routes
  - System admin tasks remain tucked away
- **Option B: Move integration management to a dedicated system admin page**
  - Create a `/system` page for admin-secret gated integration management
  - Keep vote creation focused, with a simple integration ID + admin secret attachment section

#### Decision
Implement Option B - move system integration management to a dedicated `/system` page.

#### Rationale
- Separates system admin tasks from the main vote creation flow
- Improves discoverability without cluttering primary UX
- Keeps integration attachment available during vote creation

#### Consequences
- New route: `/system` for integration management
- Create vote page links to System Admin for integration setup
- No API changes required

#### Scope
- [x] UX / product behavior
