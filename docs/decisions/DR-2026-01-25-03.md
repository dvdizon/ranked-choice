# DR-2026-01-25-03: Dynamic "Other" Options

**Decision ID:** DR-2026-01-25-03
**Status:** Accepted
**Date:** 2026-01-25
**Deciders:** User (David)

#### Context
Voters sometimes think of options not included in the original list. Enabling dynamic option addition allows for more flexible decision-making.

#### Options Considered
- **Option A: Fixed options only**
  - Only vote creator can set options
  - No changes after vote creation
- **Option B: Allow voters to suggest "Other" options**
  - Voters can add custom options during ballot submission
  - Custom options become available for subsequent voters
  - Case-insensitive duplicate checking

#### Decision
Implement Option B - Allow voters to add custom options dynamically.

#### Rationale
- Enables discovery of options not initially considered
- Maintains flexibility for casual group decisions
- New options become part of the vote organically
- Supports use case: someone suggests a new restaurant

#### Consequences
- Voting UI includes "+ Add Custom Option" button
- Custom options sent with ballot submission
- `appendVoteOptions()` function adds options to vote
- Duplicate checking prevents redundant options
- Custom options appear for all subsequent voters
- Admin can still manage options via admin panel

#### Scope
- [x] UX / product behavior
- [x] Data model
