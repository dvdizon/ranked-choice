# DR-2026-01-25-05: Optional Voter Names (Supersedes DR-2026-01-25-01)

**Decision ID:** DR-2026-01-25-05
**Status:** Accepted
**Date:** 2026-01-25
**Deciders:** User (David)

#### Context
Initially implemented required voter names for all votes (DR-2026-01-25-01). User realized this prevented anonymous voting use cases. The app should support both coordinated (named) and anonymous voting, with the vote creator deciding which to use.

#### Options Considered
- **Option A: Keep voter names always required**
  - Maintains coordination capability
  - Prevents anonymous voting use cases
- **Option B: Make voter names optional per vote**
  - Vote creator chooses requirement during vote creation
  - Checkbox on creation form (default: required)
  - Supports both anonymous and coordinated voting

#### Decision
Implement Option B - Vote creators decide whether names are required.

#### Rationale
- Flexibility for different use cases (some groups want anonymity, others want coordination)
- Vote creator knows their group's needs best
- Default to required (coordination use case) but allow anonymous option
- Maintains backward compatibility (defaults to required like before)
- Simple UI: single checkbox on creation form

#### Consequences
- Added `voter_names_required` column to `votes` table (INTEGER, default 1)
- Vote creation UI includes checkbox (default: checked)
- Ballot submission conditionally validates voter name
- Voting page shows name field as "optional" when not required
- Results and admin panels display "Anonymous" for empty voter names
- API responses include `voter_names_required` field

#### Scope
- [x] UX / product behavior
- [x] Data model

#### Notes
- Supersedes DR-2026-01-25-01 (voter names always required)
- Empty voter_name is stored as empty string in database
- Migration adds column with default value 1 (required) for existing votes
