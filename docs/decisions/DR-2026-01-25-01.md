# DR-2026-01-25-01: Non-Anonymous Voting with Voter Names

**Decision ID:** DR-2026-01-25-01
**Status:** Superseded by DR-2026-01-25-05
**Date:** 2026-01-25
**Deciders:** User (David)

#### Context
The original design had anonymous ballots. For coordination purposes (meeting up after voting), users needed to know who voted and what their preferences were.

#### Options Considered
- **Option A: Keep ballots anonymous**
  - Maintains privacy but prevents coordination
- **Option B: Add required voter name field**
  - Enables coordination and accountability
  - Names visible to all voters and admin

#### Decision
Implement Option B - Add required voter name field to all ballots.

#### Rationale
- Primary use case is coordinating meetups among friends
- Transparency helps with trust and coordination
- Users are already sharing a write secret, so not truly anonymous
- Voter names enable post-vote discussion and planning

#### Consequences
- `ballots` table requires `voter_name` column
- Database migration needed for existing data
- Ballot submission UI requires name input
- Results page displays all voter names
- Admin panel shows voter names for each ballot

#### Scope
- [x] UX / product behavior
- [x] Data model
