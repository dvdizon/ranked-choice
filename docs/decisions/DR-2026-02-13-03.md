# DR-2026-02-13-03: Deterministic Elimination for Full-Round IRV Ties

**Decision ID:** DR-2026-02-13-03  
**Status:** Accepted  
**Date:** 2026-02-13  
**Deciders:** David + Codex

## Context

IRV rounds that produced equal tallies across all remaining options were ending as explicit ties. In practice, repeating the same ballots in a runoff can reproduce the same tied outcome, adding extra steps without resolving the decision.

## Options Considered

- **Option A:** Keep explicit tie outcomes and rely on runoff rounds.
- **Option B:** Resolve full-round ties inside IRV by deterministically eliminating one option using the existing weighted tie-break ordering.

## Decision

Implement Option B. IRV now always eliminates exactly one option per non-final round, including rounds where all remaining options are tied on active tallies.

## Rationale

- Matches user requirement that IRV should not require explicit runoff rounds.
- Preserves deterministic, reproducible outcomes.
- Reuses existing tie-break order (weighted ranking support, first-round totals, lexicographic fallback), minimizing conceptual complexity.

## Consequences

- **Behavior:** Non-empty elections now converge to a deterministic winner rather than returning a pure tie result.
- **Compatibility:** Existing runoff trigger paths remain in code but become legacy/rare because pure ties are no longer expected from non-empty ballots.
- **Documentation:** IRV rules and API docs must reflect deterministic elimination in full-round ties.

## Scope

- [x] Voting rules
- [x] UX / product behavior
- [ ] Security / abuse prevention
- [ ] Deployment / ops
- [ ] Data model
- [ ] Other: API semantics for runoff trigger behavior

## Notes

The zero-ballot edge case still reports no winner.
