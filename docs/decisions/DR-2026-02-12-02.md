# DR-2026-02-12-02: Automatic Runoff for Pure IRV Ties

**Decision ID:** DR-2026-02-12-02
**Status:** Accepted
**Date:** 2026-02-12
**Deciders:** User (David)

#### Context
Users need an explicit second-round process when a vote closes in a pure tie, and they want the same group to be notified that another round is required.

#### Options Considered
- **Option A: Leave ties as final outcomes**
  - Simple and already implemented
  - Does not provide a built-in path to resolve a deadlock
- **Option B: Automatically create a runoff vote for tied options and notify the same integration**
  - Resolves ties within the product flow
  - Keeps participants informed without manual follow-up

#### Decision
Implement Option B. When an integration-enabled vote closes and IRV ends in a pure tie (`isTie=true`), automatically create a second-round runoff vote containing only the tied options and send a notification to the same integration destination.

#### Rationale
- Reduces manual work for vote organizers
- Keeps tie resolution transparent and immediate
- Reuses existing integration channels where voters already receive updates

#### Consequences
- Adds runoff tracking fields to vote records (`tie_runoff_created_at`, `tie_runoff_vote_id`) to prevent duplicate runoff creation
- Introduces a new notification event type (`runoff_required`) for Discord, Slack, and webhook integrations
- Runoff vote inherits existing vote security settings and optional auto-close duration

#### Scope
- [x] Voting rules / counting behavior
- [x] UX / product behavior
- [x] Data model
- [x] Integrations / notifications
