# DR-2026-01-31-04: Notifications Tab in Create Vote Advanced Options

**Decision ID:** DR-2026-01-31-04
**Status:** Accepted
**Date:** 2026-01-31
**Deciders:** User (David)

#### Context
Discord notification inputs were moved to the main create vote form, but this added visual noise to the primary flow.

#### Options Considered
- **Option A: Keep notifications on the main form**
  - Always visible
  - Adds clutter to the primary workflow
- **Option B: Place notifications in an advanced options tab**
  - Keeps the main form focused
  - Advanced users can still access notification settings

#### Decision
Implement Option B - move Discord notification inputs into an Advanced Options tab on the create vote page.

#### Rationale
- Keeps the main create vote path concise
- Preserves access to optional notification settings
- Aligns with other advanced configuration patterns (schedule, custom IDs)

#### Consequences
- Notifications settings appear under Advanced Options → Notifications
- Main form no longer shows Discord notification fields

#### Scope
- [x] UX / product behavior
