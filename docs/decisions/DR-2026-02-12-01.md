# DR-2026-02-12-01: Weighted Elimination Tie-Breaker for IRV

**Decision ID:** DR-2026-02-12-01
**Status:** Accepted
**Date:** 2026-02-12
**Deciders:** User (David)

#### Context
Users requested a weighted tie-breaker so elimination ties reflect broader ballot preference strength instead of relying only on first-round totals and lexicographic ordering.

#### Options Considered
- **Option A: Keep current tie-breaker (first-round totals, then lexicographic)**
  - Simple and deterministic
  - Ignores lower-preference ranking signal in tied elimination scenarios
- **Option B: Add weighted ranking support before existing fallbacks**
  - Incorporates broader voter preference information
  - Remains deterministic with explicit fallback ordering

#### Decision
Implement Option B - for elimination ties, use weighted ranking support first, then first-round totals, then lexicographic ordering.

#### Rationale
- Better reflects the full ranking data users provide on ballots
- Preserves deterministic, explainable behavior
- Keeps existing fallback logic for reproducibility

#### Consequences
- Some tie elimination outcomes may differ from previous behavior
- IRV documentation and tests must explicitly reflect the new ordering

#### Scope
- [x] RCV rules / counting behavior
