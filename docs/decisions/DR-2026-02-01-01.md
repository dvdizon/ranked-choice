# Decision Record

**Decision ID:** DR-2026-02-01-01  
**Status:** Accepted  
**Date:** 2026-02-01  
**Deciders:** Product + Engineering

#### Context
System admins need a quick way to monitor and manage active votes without collecting each vote's admin secret. The existing system admin page only manages integrations.

#### Options Considered
- **Option A:** Keep system admin limited to integrations and require per-vote secrets for all vote actions.
- **Option B:** Add admin-secret protected endpoints and UI to list live votes, close them, delete them, and re-create new votes with prefilled fields.

#### Decision
Adopt Option B: extend the system admin page with a live votes list (paginated) and admin-secret protected actions for closing and deleting votes, plus a re-create flow that pre-fills the create vote form.

#### Rationale
This keeps operations centralized for system administrators while preserving existing vote-level secrets for standard users. Re-create is implemented as a convenience link without exposing secrets.

#### Consequences
- **Behavior:** System admins can manage live votes from `/system` without per-vote secrets.
- **UX:** Adds a paginated admin list and quick actions for closing/deleting votes.
- **Security:** Actions require `ADMIN_SECRET` and do not expose vote secrets.
- **Technical constraints:** Adds admin endpoints for listing and managing live votes.

#### Scope
- [ ] Voting rules
- [x] UX / product behavior
- [x] Security / abuse prevention
- [ ] Deployment / ops
- [ ] Data model
- [x] Other: Admin tooling

#### Notes
Re-create links populate the create-vote form through query parameters; secrets are intentionally left blank.
