# DR-2026-01-25-06: Auto-Close Voting Deadlines

**Decision ID:** DR-2026-01-25-06
**Status:** Accepted
**Date:** 2026-01-25
**Deciders:** User (David)

#### Context
Vote creators wanted a way to set a deadline so voting ends automatically without requiring manual admin action.

#### Options Considered
- **Option A: Manual close only**
  - Admin must close votes when finished
  - Requires active management
- **Option B: Optional auto-close date/time**
  - Creator sets a deadline during creation or in admin panel
  - Vote closes automatically when deadline passes

#### Decision
Implement Option B - Optional auto-close date/time per vote.

#### Rationale
- Reduces ongoing admin burden
- Prevents votes from being left open accidentally
- Fits common use case of time-boxed decisions
- Keeps manual close available when needed

#### Consequences
- Added `auto_close_at` column to `votes`
- Vote creation supports an optional auto-close input
- Admin panel can set/change/remove auto-close time
- Vote auto-closes when deadline passes (checked on access)
- API supports `autoCloseAt` and `setAutoClose`

#### Scope
- [x] UX / product behavior
- [x] Data model
