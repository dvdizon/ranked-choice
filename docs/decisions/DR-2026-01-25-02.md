# DR-2026-01-25-02: Opt-Out Voting Behavior

**Decision ID:** DR-2026-01-25-02
**Status:** Accepted
**Date:** 2026-01-25
**Deciders:** User (David)

#### Context
Original voting UX was opt-in: voters manually added options they wanted to rank. This created cognitive burden and could lead to ballot exhaustion if voters forgot to add preferred options.

#### Options Considered
- **Option A: Keep opt-in (add what you want)**
  - Voters click "+" to add options to rankings
  - Empty rankings by default
- **Option B: Opt-out (remove what you don't want)**
  - All options pre-ranked in random order
  - Voters remove unwanted options
  - Reduces cognitive load

#### Decision
Implement Option B - Start with all options ranked in randomized order.

#### Rationale
- Reduces voter effort and cognitive load
- Prevents accidental ballot exhaustion from forgetting to add options
- Random initial order prevents positional bias
- Aligns with "choose what NOT to do" mental model
- Better default for small groups deciding where to eat

#### Consequences
- Voting page loads with all options already ranked
- Fisher-Yates shuffle ensures randomization
- "Removed Options" section appears only after removal
- Help text updated to reflect opt-out behavior

#### Scope
- [x] UX / product behavior
