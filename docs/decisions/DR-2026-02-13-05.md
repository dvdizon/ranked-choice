# DR-2026-02-13-05: Explain Elimination Cause in Results

**Decision ID:** DR-2026-02-13-05  
**Status:** Accepted  
**Date:** 2026-02-13  
**Deciders:** David + Codex

## Context

Even with deterministic IRV tie-breaking, users can still be unclear about why a specific option was eliminated during a tied round. The results page already shows who was eliminated, but not the tie-break rationale.

## Options Considered

- **Option A:** Keep current results output and rely on static rules text.
- **Option B:** Add explicit per-round elimination-cause metadata and render human-readable explanations in results UI.

## Decision

Implement Option B. Extend IRV round output to include `eliminationCause` metadata and show a plain-language explanation beneath each elimination in the results page.

## Rationale

- Improves explainability for non-expert users without changing counting behavior.
- Makes tie-break outcomes auditable round-by-round.
- Keeps the deterministic rule set visible at the point where users need context.

## Consequences

- **Behavior:** IRV outcomes are unchanged; output now includes additional explanation fields.
- **UX:** Results page explicitly states whether elimination came from lowest votes, weighted support, first-round totals, or lexicographic fallback.
- **API:** Results payload includes `rounds[*].eliminationCause`.
- **Docs:** API and README must describe the new explanation field.

## Scope

- [ ] Voting rules
- [x] UX / product behavior
- [ ] Security / abuse prevention
- [ ] Deployment / ops
- [ ] Data model
- [x] Other: API response shape (additive)

## Notes

This change is additive and preserves backwards compatibility for consumers that ignore unknown fields.
