# Decision Record

**Decision ID:** DR-2026-01-31-05  
**Status:** Accepted  
**Date:** 2026-01-31  
**Deciders:** Codex + project maintainers

## Context
The system admin live votes list includes a re-create vote action rendered as a link. It looked inconsistent next to the other buttons because the link did not inherit base button styling, making the action harder to scan and use quickly.

## Options Considered
- **Option A:** Convert the link to a button element with JavaScript navigation.
- **Option B:** Apply consistent button styling to secondary action links so they match button affordances.

## Decision
Choose Option B: extend the secondary button styles so link-based actions are visually consistent with button actions.

## Rationale
The link keeps existing navigation semantics while improving visual clarity. Styling the secondary button class provides consistent affordances without changing behavior.

## Consequences
- The re-create vote action aligns visually with adjacent button actions.
- Other future secondary action links will inherit the same consistent styling.

## Scope
- [ ] Voting rules
- [x] UX / product behavior
- [ ] Security / abuse prevention
- [ ] Deployment / ops
- [ ] Data model
- [ ] Other: UI styling

## Notes
No behavioral changes beyond visual affordance improvements.
