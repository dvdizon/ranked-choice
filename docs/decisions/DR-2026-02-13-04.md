# DR-2026-02-13-04: Remove Manual Runoff Trigger UI/API Paths

**Decision ID:** DR-2026-02-13-04  
**Status:** Accepted  
**Date:** 2026-02-13  
**Deciders:** David + Codex

## Context

After adopting deterministic elimination for full-round IRV ties, manual runoff-trigger actions became redundant. Keeping those controls in UI and API increased surface area without practical value.

## Options Considered

- **Option A:** Keep manual runoff trigger controls as legacy paths.
- **Option B:** Remove manual runoff trigger UI and API actions.

## Decision

Implement Option B. Remove manual tie-breaker runoff trigger paths from vote-admin and system-admin UIs and from the PATCH admin API action handlers.

## Rationale

- Matches current IRV behavior where non-empty elections resolve deterministically without explicit runoff triggers.
- Reduces maintenance and avoids user confusion around obsolete actions.

## Consequences

- **Behavior:** Admins can no longer request `triggerTieBreaker` through vote or system admin PATCH actions.
- **UX:** Tie-breaker trigger buttons are removed from vote admin and system admin views.
- **Docs:** API docs and change logs must no longer advertise manual trigger actions.

## Scope

- [ ] Voting rules
- [x] UX / product behavior
- [ ] Security / abuse prevention
- [ ] Deployment / ops
- [ ] Data model
- [x] Other: API surface reduction

## Notes

This supersedes manual-trigger portions of DR-2026-02-13-01.
